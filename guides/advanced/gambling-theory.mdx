<Warning>
**Advanced strategy for experienced investors only.**

Gambling theory requires understanding probability, expected value, and risk of ruin. Misapplication can lead to significant losses.
</Warning>

## What is Gambling Theory in Investing?

Gambling theory applies mathematical frameworks from casino games to investing:
- **Kelly Criterion:** Optimal position sizing
- **Expected Value (EV):** Probability-weighted outcomes
- **Risk of Ruin:** Chance of losing everything

**Why use it:** Maximize long-term growth while controlling risk

**When to use it:** When you have high conviction backed by data

---

## The Kelly Criterion

### Formula

**Kelly % = (Win% × Avg Win - Loss% × Avg Loss) / Avg Win**

**Simplified:**
- **Win% =** Probability trade succeeds (e.g., 60%)
- **Avg Win =** Average gain when right (e.g., 20%)
- **Loss% =** Probability trade fails (e.g., 40%)
- **Avg Loss =** Average loss when wrong (e.g., 10%)

**Example calculation:**
```
Kelly % = (0.60 × 20 - 0.40 × 10) / 20
        = (12 - 4) / 20
        = 0.40 or 40%
```

**Recommended:** Use **Half Kelly (20%)** to reduce volatility

---

## Using Bloom to Calculate Kelly

**Prompt:** "Analyze this trade for expected value:
- Stock: NVDA
- Entry: $850
- Target: $1,000 (+17.6%)
- Stop-loss: $800 (-5.9%)
- Confidence: 65%"

**AI analysis:**
- **Win probability:** 65%
- **Win amount:** +$150 (17.6%)
- **Loss probability:** 35%
- **Loss amount:** -$50 (5.9%)

**Kelly calculation:**
```
Kelly % = (0.65 × 150 - 0.35 × 50) / 150
        = (97.5 - 17.5) / 150
        = 0.53 or 53%
```

**Half Kelly = 26.5%** of portfolio in NVDA

**Ask Bloom:** "What position size should I use for this trade using Kelly Criterion?"

---

## Expected Value (EV) Analysis

### What is EV?

**EV = (Win% × Win$) - (Loss% × Loss$)**

**Positive EV (+EV):** Take the trade
**Negative EV (-EV):** Skip the trade

---

### Example: Evaluating a Stock Trade

**Stock:** Tesla at $250
**Target:** $300 (+20%)
**Stop-loss:** $230 (-8%)
**Your analysis:** 70% chance of hitting target

**EV calculation:**
```
EV = (0.70 × $50) - (0.30 × $20)
   = $35 - $6
   = +$29 per $250 invested
```

**Result:** +EV trade (expected $29 profit per $250 risked)

**Ask Bloom:** "Calculate the expected value of buying Tesla at $250 with $300 target and $230 stop-loss"

---

## Risk of Ruin

### What is it?

**Risk of Ruin:** Probability of losing your entire capital

**Formula (simplified):**
- Never risk more than **2% per trade**
- Keep **at least 20 uncorrelated positions** to avoid total loss

---

### Example Scenario

**Portfolio:** $100,000
**Max risk per trade:** 2% ($2,000)
**Stop-loss:** 10% below entry

**Position size:** $2,000 / 0.10 = $20,000 (20% of portfolio)

**If stop-loss hits:** Lose $2,000 (2% of portfolio)
**If target hits:** Gain varies by upside

**Ask Bloom:** "If I risk 2% per trade, how much should I invest in a stock with a 10% stop-loss?"

---

## Applying Gambling Theory to Stock Picks

### Step 1: Assess Probability

**Ask Bloom:** "What's the probability AAPL reaches $200 in 6 months?"

**AI considers:**
- Historical volatility
- Analyst targets
- Technical indicators
- Earnings momentum

**AI returns:** "65% probability based on current trends"

---

### Step 2: Define Win/Loss Scenarios

**Win scenario:** Stock hits $200 (+15%)
**Loss scenario:** Stop-loss at $165 (-5%)

---

### Step 3: Calculate EV

**EV = (0.65 × 15%) - (0.35 × 5%)**
**EV = 9.75% - 1.75% = +8% expected return**

**Conclusion:** +EV trade

---

### Step 4: Size Position Using Kelly

**Kelly % = (0.65 × 15 - 0.35 × 5) / 15 = 43%**
**Half Kelly = 21.5% of portfolio**

**On $100k portfolio:** Invest $21,500 in AAPL

---

## When NOT to Use Gambling Theory

<Warning>
**Avoid gambling theory when:**
- You can't quantify probabilities (no data)
- The outcome is binary (all-or-nothing bets)
- You're emotional about the trade (bias clouds judgment)
- Position would exceed 25% of portfolio (too concentrated)
- You don't understand the math (stick to simple 5-10% positions)
</Warning>

## Practical Bloom Workflows

### Workflow 1: Calculate Kelly Position Size

**Prompt:** "I want to buy [STOCK]. Help me calculate Kelly position size:
- Entry price: $X
- Target price: $Y
- Stop-loss: $Z
- My confidence level: [%]"

**AI returns:** Recommended position size and EV

---

### Workflow 2: Validate High-Conviction Trades

**Prompt:** "Analyze this trade for expected value:
- Stock: [TICKER]
- Thesis: [WHY YOU LIKE IT]
- Upside: [%]
- Downside: [%]
- Time horizon: [MONTHS]"

**AI returns:** Probability assessment, EV calculation, position sizing

---

### Workflow 3: Portfolio-Level Risk Management

- Total capital: $X
- Number of positions: Y
- Largest position: Z%
- Average correlation: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]"

**AI returns:** Risk assessment and diversification recommendations

## Example: Full Gambling Theory Analysis

**Stock:** Microsoft (MSFT)
**Current price:** $400
**Thesis:** Azure AI growth will drive earnings beat

**Ask Bloom:** "Help me size a position in MSFT at $400"

**AI analysis:**
1. **Probability of 10%+ gain:** 70% (based on earnings momentum, analyst upgrades)
2. **Upside target:** $450 (+12.5%)
3. **Downside stop:** $380 (-5%)
4. **EV calculation:** (0.70 × 12.5) - (0.30 × 5) = +7.25% expected return
5. **Kelly %:** (0.70 × 50 - 0.30 × 20) / 50 = 58%
6. **Half Kelly:** 29% of portfolio

**Recommendation:** Invest 25-30% of portfolio in MSFT (cap at 30% for safety)

✅ **Half Kelly** reduces volatility (recommended over full Kelly)
✅ **EV analysis** separates good trades from bad trades
✅ **Risk of Ruin** prevented by limiting risk to 2% per trade
