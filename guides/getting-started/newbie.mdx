## What is Investing?

Investing means buying assets (stocks, ETFs, bonds) that can grow in value over time.

**Key concepts:**
- **Stocks:** Own a piece of a company (e.g., Apple, Microsoft)
- **ETFs:** Baskets of stocks (e.g., SPY holds 500 stocks)
- **Bonds:** Loans to companies/governments (safer, lower returns)

## Before You Invest

### 1. Build an Emergency Fund
Save 3-6 months of expenses in cash before investing. Markets go downâ€”you need a safety net.

### 2. Assess Your Risk Tolerance
Ask yourself: "Can I handle losing 30% in a year?" If no, start with safer investments (index ETFs).

### 3. Start Small
Invest 10% of your income. Don't invest money you'll need in the next 5 years.

## Common Beginner Mistakes

<Warning>
**Don't do this:**
- Invest in meme stocks (GameStop, AMC) as your first investment
- Put all money in one stock (diversify with 5-10 stocks or an ETF)
- Check prices every hour (invest for years, not days)
- Follow tips from social media without research
</Warning>

## Example First Portfolio

**Conservative (beginner-friendly):**
- 60% index ETF (SPY or VOO)
- 20% big tech (AAPL or MSFT)
- 10% dividend stock (JNJ or KO)
- 10% cash (for buying dips)
