## Sarah's Investment Workflow

### Weekly: Portfolio Review (30 Minutes)

**Saturday Morning:**

<Accordion title="Step 1: Check Portfolio Performance" icon="chart-line">
Opens Bloom on laptop, reviews portfolio:
- Total return: +18% YTD vs +12% S&P 500 (outperforming)
- Top performer: NVDA (+45%)
- Worst performer: TSLA (-12%)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 2: AI Portfolio Analysis" icon="robot">
Asks: "Analyze my portfolio: 25% AAPL, 20% MSFT, 20% GOOGL, 20% NVDA, 15% TSLA. What are the risks?"

**AI Findings:**
- 100% tech concentration (HIGH RISK)
- Correlation: 0.75 (stocks move together)
- Volatility: 35% higher than market
- Recommendation: Add defensive stocks (healthcare, utilities)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 3: Research Defensive Additions" icon="magnifying-glass">
Browses "Defensive Holdings" collection:
- JNJ: Dividend aristocrat, healthcare leader
- PG: Consumer staples, recession-proof
- NEE: Utility, stable cash flows

Asks AI: "Compare JNJ vs PG for defensive exposure"

**Decision:** Adds JNJ to "Buy List" (plans to buy next month)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 4: Set Goals for Next Week" icon="clipboard-check">
- Monitor TSLA earnings (Jan 2)
- Research JNJ in more depth
- Save $1,000 to buy JNJ shares
- Rebalance if NVDA hits 30% (take profits)
</Accordion>

### Monthly: Deep Dive Research (1-2 Hours)

**First Sunday of Month:**

1. **Review Holdings:** Check each stock's recent earnings, news, analyst ratings
2. **Update Investment Theses:** Document why I still own each stock
3. **Tax-Loss Harvesting:** Identify losers to sell for tax benefits (Q4 only)
4. **Rebalancing:** Trim winners, add to losers, maintain target allocations
5. **New Ideas:** Research 2-3 stocks from Daily Ideas for potential additions
