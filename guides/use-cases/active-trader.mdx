## Mike's Key Strategies with Bloom

### Strategy 1: Earnings Plays

**Before Earnings:**
1. AI analyzes last 4 quarters: "Did TSLA beat or miss?"
2. Search transcripts: "What did management say about demand?"
3. Check technical setup for post-earnings move

**After Earnings:**
1. Get instant "Why It's Moving" analysis
2. Check if beat/miss aligns with stock reaction
3. Enter trades based on momentum

### Strategy 2: Breakout Trading

**Setup:**
