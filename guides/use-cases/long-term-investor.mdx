## Meet James

**Profile:**
- Age: 58
- Occupation: Dentist
- Net Worth: $1.2M ($800K in stocks)
- Goal: Retire in 7 years at 65
- Risk Tolerance: Conservative (can't afford losses)

**Challenge:** James needs to ensure his portfolio is properly diversified and not overexposed to any sector or risk factor before retirement. He wants stable growth with downside protection.

## How Bloom Helps

### Initial Portfolio Review

<Steps>
  <Step title="Current Holdings (Before Bloom)">
    James's portfolio when he found Bloom:
    - AAPL: 15% ($120,000)
    - GOOGL: 12% ($96,000)
    - MSFT: 12% ($96,000)
    - AMZN: 10% ($80,000)
    - NVDA: 8% ($64,000)
    - META: 8% ($64,000)
    - 35 other stocks: 35% ($280,000)

    **Total:** 45% mega-cap tech (concerning)
  </Step>

  <Step title="AI Portfolio Analysis">
    James inputs portfolio into Bloom AI:

    **Ask:** "Analyze my portfolio for risks. I'm 58 and retiring in 7 years."

    **AI Findings:**
    - **Sector Concentration:** 65% technology (EXTREME RISK)
    - **Correlation:** 0.78 (holdings move together)
    - **Volatility:** Beta 1.45 (45% more volatile than market)
    - **Age-Inappropriate:** Too aggressive for near-retirement
    - **Downside Risk:** Could drop 50% in tech crash

    **Recommendation:** Immediate rebalancing needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Rebalancing Plan">
    **AI Suggests:**

    **Reduce Tech (65% → 40%):**
    - Trim AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT by 30%
    - Eliminate smaller tech positions

    **Add Defensive Sectors (35% → 45%):**
    - Healthcare: 20% (JNJ, UNH, ABBV)
    - Consumer Staples: 10% (PG, KO, WMT)
    - Utilities: 10% (NEE, DUK, SO)
    - REITs: 5% (O, VNQ)

    **Add Fixed Income (0% → 15%):**
    - Bond ETF: AGG or BND

    **Expected Impact:**
    - Reduce beta from 1.45 → 1.1
    - Lower correlation to 0.5
    - Increase diversification score: 3/10 → 7/10
    - Reduce max drawdown: -50% → -30%
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Rebalancing Execution (Over 6 Months)

<Accordion title="Month 1: Research Defensive Stocks" icon="magnifying-glass">
James uses Bloom to research:
- **JNJ (Johnson & Johnson):**
  - 62 years of dividend increases
  - Diversified: Pharma + MedTech
  - Yield: 3.1%
  - AI Rating: STRONG BUY for defensive exposure

- **PG (Procter & Gamble):**
  - Essential consumer products
  - Beta: 0.42 (58% less volatile)
  - Pricing power
  - AI Rating: BUY

Adds both to "Buy List"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Month 2: Tax-Loss Harvesting" icon="receipt">
**Goal:** Minimize tax impact of rebalancing

AI helps identify:
- Losing positions to sell first (offset gains)
- Similar stocks to swap (avoid wash sales)

**Example:**
- Sell PYPL (down 15%) → Buy SQ (similar, avoid wash sale)
- Loss: $12,000 → Offsets gains from AAPL sale
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Months 3-6: Gradual Rebalancing" icon="scale-balanced">
**Strategy:** Sell tech winners gradually (avoid big tax hit)

**Execution:**
- Month 3: Trim AAPL 5%, buy JNJ
- Month 4: Trim GOOGL 5%, buy PG
- Month 5: Trim MSFT 5%, buy NEE (utility)
- Month 6: Add AGG (bond ETF) with new cash

**Tax Management:**
- Spread gains over 2 tax years
- Offset with losses where possible
- Total tax bill: $18,000 (vs $35,000 if done in 1 month)
</Accordion>

### Ongoing Management (Quarterly Reviews)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Q1 Review: Check Drift">
    Asks AI: "How has my portfolio drifted from targets?"

    **AI Response:**
    - Tech drifted from 40% → 45% (NVDA up 30%)
    - Healthcare: 20% → 18% (JNJ flat)
    - Action: Trim 5% NVDA, add to JNJ

    **Rebalancing trade:**
    - Sell $40,000 NVDA → Buy JNJ
  </Step>

  <Step title="Q2 Review: Dividend Tracking">
    **Dividend Income (Quarterly):**
    - Total: $6,200
    - Annualized: $24,800 (3.1% yield)
    - Growing 7-8% annually

    **Plan:** Reinvest dividends into underweighted sectors
  </Step>

  <Step title="Q3 Review: Risk Assessment">
    AI analyzes updated portfolio:
    - Beta: 1.08 (target: 1.1) ✅
    - Diversification: 7/10 (target: 7+) ✅
    - Correlation: 0.48 (target: below 0.5) ✅
    - Downside protection: Max drawdown ~28%

    **Status:** Portfolio aligned with retirement goals
  </Step>

  <Step title="Q4 Review: Tax Planning">
    **Actions:**
    - Tax-loss harvest losers (if any)
    - Harvest long-term gains if in low-income year
    - Rebalance within IRAs first (tax-free)
  </Step>
</Steps>
