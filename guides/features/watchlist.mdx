### Watchlist Management Tips

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with 1-2 Watchlists">
    Don't overcomplicate—begin with "Core Holdings" and "Research Ideas"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Limit Each Watchlist to 20-30 Stocks">
    Too many stocks = information overload. Quality over quantity.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Quarterly">
    Every 3 months, prune watchlists:
    - Remove stocks no longer relevant
    - Move researched stocks to Core Holdings or delete
    - Add new opportunities
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Good: "Tech Growth 2025", "Dividend Income", "Biotech Speculative"

    Bad: "Watchlist 1", "Stocks", "List A"
  </Step>
</Steps>
