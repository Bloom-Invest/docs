## Overview

Learn how to write effective prompts to get the most value from Bloom's AI Assistant. The quality of your questions directly impacts the quality of insights you receive.

## Prompt Writing Principles

### 1. Be Specific

<Columns cols={2}>
  <div>
    **❌ Vague:**
    - "Tell me about Apple"
    - "Is this stock good?"
    - "What should I buy?"
  </div>
  <div>
    **✅ Specific:**
    - "Analyze Apple's Services revenue growth and margin trends"
    - "Should I buy Microsoft given its current P/E of 35 and 15% growth rate?"
    - "Find undervalued healthcare stocks with P/E < 15 and revenue growth > 20%"
  </div>
</Columns>

**Why It Matters:** Specific prompts help the AI understand exactly what you want, leading to focused, actionable responses.

---

### 2. Provide Context

<Columns cols={2}>
  <div>
    **❌ No Context:**
    - "Is NVDA a good buy?"
  </div>
  <div>
    **✅ With Context:**
    - "Is NVDA a good buy for a 10-year growth portfolio, considering I already have 20% in tech stocks?"
  </div>
</Columns>

**Why It Matters:** Context helps the AI tailor recommendations to your situation (time horizon, risk tolerance, existing holdings).

---

### 3. Ask Follow-Up Questions

The AI remembers your conversation context. Build on previous answers:

**Conversation Example:**
1. **You:** "Analyze Tesla's recent earnings"
2. **AI:** [Provides earnings analysis]
3. **You:** "What are the main risks?" *(builds on context)*
4. **AI:** [Focuses on Tesla-specific risks]
5. **You:** "How does this compare to traditional automakers?" *(further refinement)*
6. **AI:** [Compares Tesla to Ford, GM, etc.]

---

### 4. Request Specific Formats

Tell the AI how you want the information structured:

- "Give me a bull and bear case for Netflix"
- "Create a 5-point checklist for evaluating this stock"
- "Compare these 3 stocks in a table format"
- "Summarize in 3 bullet points"

---

### 5. Combine Multiple Analyses

The AI can handle complex, multi-part questions:

**Good Multi-Part Prompt:**
```
"Analyze Apple's fundamentals (revenue growth, margins, cash flow),
then check if the technicals support buying now (RSI, moving averages),
and finally compare its valuation to Microsoft and Google"
```

The AI will systematically work through each part.

## Advanced Prompt Techniques

### Chain of Thought

Break complex questions into steps:

**Prompt:**
```
"Let's analyze Microsoft step by step:
1. First, review the fundamentals (growth, margins, cash flow)
2. Then, assess the valuation vs historical and peers
3. Next, check the technicals for entry timing
4. Finally, give me a buy/hold/sell recommendation with reasoning"
```

**Why It Works:** Structured approach ensures thorough analysis.

---

### Comparative Analysis

Force the AI to weigh trade-offs:

**Prompt:**
```
"I'm choosing between Apple and Microsoft for a long-term hold.
Create a table comparing:
- Revenue growth (3-year CAGR)
- Operating margins
- P/E ratio and PEG ratio
- Moat strength
- AI strategy and execution
Then recommend which is better for my goals"
```

**Why It Works:** Side-by-side comparison clarifies differences.

---

### Scenario Planning

Ask "what if" questions:

**Prompt:**
```
"What would happen to my tech-heavy portfolio (60% tech)
in these scenarios:
1. Fed raises rates 2% more
2. Recession hits in 2025
3. AI hype cycle ends
Give me the likely outcomes and how to prepare"
```

**Why It Works:** Helps you prepare for different market conditions.

---

### Devil's Advocate

Challenge your own assumptions:

**Prompt:**
```
"I'm bullish on Tesla and own 15% of my portfolio in TSLA.
Play devil's advocate and give me the strongest bear case.
Should I reduce my position?"
```

**Why It Works:** Counteracts confirmation bias, reveals blind spots.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
**❌ Being Too Vague**

Bad: "Is the market good?"

Better: "Are tech stocks overvalued right now based on P/E ratios and growth expectations?"
</Warning>

<Warning>
**❌ Asking Yes/No Questions**

Bad: "Should I buy Tesla?"

Better: "Analyze Tesla's fundamentals, valuation, and risks. Is it a good buy for a 5-year hold?"
</Warning>

<Warning>
**❌ Not Providing Your Situation**

Bad: "What stocks should I buy?"

Better: "I'm 35 years old with a 20-year time horizon and high risk tolerance. What growth stocks should I consider?"
</Warning>

<Warning>
**❌ Ignoring Follow-Ups**

Bad: Getting one answer and moving on

Better: Ask clarifying questions: "Can you elaborate on that risk?" or "How does that compare to competitors?"
</Warning>
