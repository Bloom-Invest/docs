## What is an ETF?

An **ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund)** is a basket of stocks that trades like a single stock.

**Example:** SPY holds all 500 stocks in the S&P 500. Buy 1 share of SPY = own a piece of 500 companies.

**ETF vs Stock:**
- **Stock:** Own 1 company (AAPL = only Apple)
- **ETF:** Own 100s of companies (SPY = 500 companies)

**ETF vs Mutual Fund:**
- **ETF:** Trades instantly during market hours (like a stock)
- **Mutual Fund:** Trades once per day at close

## How to Evaluate ETF Quality

### 1. Expense Ratio (Lower is Better)
**What it is:** Annual fee charged by the ETF

**Good:** < 0.20%
**Excellent:** < 0.10%

**Example:** SPY charges 0.09% ($9 per year on $10,000)

**Ask Bloom:** "What's the expense ratio of QQQ vs VOO?"

---

### 2. Assets Under Management (Bigger is Better)
**What it is:** Total money invested in the ETF

**Good:** > $500M
**Excellent:** > $10B

**Why it matters:** Large ETFs are more liquid (easier to buy/sell)

---

### 3. Tracking Error (Lower is Better)
**What it is:** How closely the ETF follows its index

**Good:** < 0.5%

**Ask Bloom:** "Does SPY accurately track the S&P 500?"

---

### 4. Average Daily Volume (Higher is Better)
**What it is:** How many shares trade per day

**Good:** > 1M shares/day

**Why it matters:** High volume = easier to buy/sell without moving the price

## ETF vs Individual Stocks: When to Use Each

### Use ETFs When:
✅ You're a beginner (less risk)
✅ You want passive investing (set and forget)
✅ You have limited time for research
✅ You want guaranteed diversification

### Use Individual Stocks When:
✅ You enjoy researching companies
✅ You want higher potential returns
✅ You have conviction in specific businesses
✅ You're willing to accept higher risk

**Best approach:** 60% ETFs + 40% individual stocks

---

## Common ETF Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
**Don't:**
- Buy thematic ETFs at peak hype (ARKK in 2021 = -60% loss)
- Ignore expense ratios (0.75% vs 0.05% = $700 difference on $100k over 10 years)
- Overlap ETFs (SPY + VOO = same 500 stocks twice)
- Trade ETFs frequently (they're for long-term holding)
- Buy leveraged ETFs (3x bull/bear) without understanding risks
</Warning>
