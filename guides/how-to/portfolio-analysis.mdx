## AI-Powered Portfolio Analysis

### Get Comprehensive Review

**AI Prompt:**
```
"Analyze my portfolio: 25% AAPL, 20% GOOGL, 20% MSFT, 15% NVDA, 20% AMZN.
What are the risks and how should I rebalance?"
```

**What the AI Analyzes:**

<Accordion title="Sector Concentration" icon="chart-pie" defaultOpen>
**What It Checks:**
- % allocated to each sector (Tech, Healthcare, Finance, etc.)
- Concentration risk (>40% in one sector = high risk)
- Sector correlation (do sectors move together?)

**Example Output:**
> **Sector Breakdown:**
> - Technology: 100%
> - Healthcare: 0%
> - Financials: 0%
> - Consumer: 0%
> - Utilities: 0%
>
> **Risk Assessment:** ⚠️ EXTREMELY HIGH
> - 100% concentration in technology sector
> - Highly vulnerable to tech sell-offs
> - No defensive exposure
>
> **Recommendation:** Reduce tech to 60-70%, add healthcare (15%), consumer staples (10%), utilities (10%)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Stock Correlation" icon="link">
**What It Checks:**
- How closely holdings move together
- Correlation coefficient (-1 to +1)
- Diversification quality

**Example Output:**
> **Correlation Matrix:**
> ```
>        AAPL  GOOGL  MSFT  NVDA  AMZN
> AAPL   1.00   0.75  0.82  0.68  0.71
> GOOGL  0.75   1.00  0.78  0.65  0.80
> MSFT   0.82   0.78  1.00  0.70  0.74
> NVDA   0.68   0.65  0.70  1.00  0.62
> AMZN   0.71   0.80  0.74  0.62  1.00
> ```
>
> **Average Correlation:** 0.73 (HIGH)
> - These stocks tend to move together
> - Limited diversification benefit
> - Portfolio will be volatile
>
> **Recommendation:** Add uncorrelated assets (REITs, commodities, international)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Risk Metrics" icon="triangle-exclamation">
**What It Calculates:**
- Portfolio beta (volatility vs market)
- Standard deviation (price volatility)
- Max drawdown (worst decline)
- Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted returns)

**Example Output:**
> **Risk Metrics:**
> - **Beta:** 1.38 (38% more volatile than S&P 500)
> - **Std Deviation:** 24% annually
> - **Max Drawdown:** -42% (during 2022 tech sell-off)
> - **Sharpe Ratio:** 1.2 (good risk-adjusted returns)
>
> **Risk Level:** HIGH
> - Expect large swings (-20% to +30% annually)
> - Not suitable for conservative investors
> - Consider reducing volatility with bonds/defensive stocks
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Diversification Score" icon="star">
**What It Measures:**
- Number of holdings
- Sector balance
- Correlation
- Overall diversification quality

**Example Output:**
> **Diversification Score:** 3/10 ⚠️
>
> **Breakdown:**
> - Holdings count: 5 stocks (need 15-20 for good diversification)
> - Sector diversity: 1 sector (need 5-6 sectors)
> - Correlation: 0.73 (too high, want below 0.5)
> - International exposure: 0% (want 10-20%)
>
> **Grade:** POOR - Lacks meaningful diversification
</Accordion>

## Rebalancing Strategies

### When to Rebalance

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Time-Based" icon="calendar">
    Rebalance on a schedule regardless of market conditions:
    - Quarterly (every 3 months)
    - Semi-annually (every 6 months)
    - Annually (once per year)

    **Pros:** Disciplined, prevents emotional decisions

    **Cons:** May miss opportunities, ignores market conditions
  </Card>

  <Card title="Threshold-Based" icon="percentage">
    Rebalance when allocations drift beyond targets:
    - 5% threshold (e.g., 25% → 30%+)
    - 10% threshold (more relaxed)

    **Pros:** Only rebalance when necessary, tax-efficient

    **Cons:** Requires monitoring
  </Card>

  <Card title="Event-Based" icon="bell">
    Rebalance after significant events:
    - Major market correction
    - Earnings disappointment
    - Thesis change
    - New capital to invest

    **Pros:** Responsive to changes, opportunistic

    **Cons:** Requires active management
  </Card>

  <Card title="Hybrid Approach" icon="gears">
    Combine methods:
    - Annual review minimum
    - Plus threshold triggers (>10% drift)
    - Plus event-based adjustments

    **Pros:** Best of all worlds

    **Cons:** More complex
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How to Rebalance

**AI Prompt:**
```
"My portfolio drifted from target allocations.
Target: 20% each in AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN
Current: 30% NVDA, 22% AAPL, 18% GOOGL, 16% MSFT, 14% AMZN
How should I rebalance?"
```

**AI Provides:**
1. **Sell Recommendations:** Which stocks to trim and by how much
2. **Buy Recommendations:** Which stocks to add to
3. **Tax Considerations:** Short-term vs long-term gains
4. **Trade Order:** Optimal sequence for rebalancing

**Example Output:**
> **Rebalancing Plan:**
>
> **Sell:**
> - NVDA: Sell 10% (trim from 30% → 20%)
> - AAPL: Sell 2% (trim from 22% → 20%)
>
> **Buy:**
> - GOOGL: Buy 2% (increase from 18% → 20%)
> - MSFT: Buy 4% (increase from 16% → 20%)
> - AMZN: Buy 6% (increase from 14% → 20%)
>
> **Tax Impact:**
> - NVDA: Long-term gain (held 2+ years) → 15-20% tax
> - AAPL: Short-term gain (held 8 months) → ordinary income tax
>
> **Recommendation:** Consider waiting 4 months for AAPL to become long-term, or offset with tax-loss harvesting

## Optimization Techniques

### Tax-Loss Harvesting

**AI Prompt:**
```
"Which holdings in my portfolio are down and can be tax-loss harvested?"
```

**Strategy:**
1. Identify losers (stocks down >10%)
2. Sell to realize loss
3. Buy similar (not identical) stock
4. Use loss to offset gains

**Example:**
> Sell AMD (down 15%) → Buy NVDA
> Loss: $3,000 → Offsets $3,000 in capital gains

---

### Sector Rotation

**AI Prompt:**
```
"Which sectors are outperforming right now? Should I rotate my portfolio?"
```

**Strategy:**
- Identify sector trends
- Rotate into leaders
- Reduce exposure to laggards

**Example:**
> **Current Leaders:** Energy, Utilities, Healthcare
> **Current Laggards:** Tech, Consumer Discretionary
>
> **Action:** Trim tech (NVDA, GOOGL) by 10%, add energy (XLE ETF) and healthcare (JNJ, UNH)

---

### Risk Parity

**Goal:** Balance risk contribution, not dollar amounts

**AI Prompt:**
```
"Optimize my portfolio for equal risk contribution across holdings"
```

**Concept:**
- Volatile stocks get smaller allocations
- Stable stocks get larger allocations
- Result: Balanced risk, smoother returns

**Example:**
> **Traditional (Equal Weight):**
> - NVDA (high vol): 20%
> - JNJ (low vol): 20%
>
> **Risk Parity:**
> - NVDA (high vol): 10%
> - JNJ (low vol): 30%
