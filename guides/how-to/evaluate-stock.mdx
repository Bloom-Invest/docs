## The 5-Point Evaluation Framework

Use Bloom's AI to evaluate stocks across 5 dimensions:

### 1. Fundamentals (Business Quality)

**Ask Bloom:** "Analyze [STOCK]'s fundamentals"

**What to check:**
- **P/E Ratio:** < 25 is reasonable for most stocks
- **Revenue Growth:** Ideally 10%+ per year
- **Profit Margins:** Higher = better (check vs competitors)
- **Debt:** Low debt-to-equity (< 1.0 is good)

**Example:** "Is Apple's P/E ratio of 28 justified by its growth?"

---

### 2. Earnings (Recent Performance)

**Ask Bloom:** "Analyze [STOCK]'s last 4 quarters of earnings"

**What to check:**
- Beat or miss estimates?
- Earnings growth trend (up or down?)
- Forward guidance (optimistic or cautious?)

**Red flag:** 2+ quarters of missed earnings

**Example:** "Did Microsoft beat earnings estimates last quarter?"

---

### 3. Technicals (Entry Timing)

**Ask Bloom:** "Show me [STOCK]'s technical analysis"

**What to check:**
- **RSI:** < 30 = oversold (good entry), > 70 = overbought (wait)
- **Trend:** Above 50-day and 200-day moving averages = bullish
- **Support:** Recent low price where stock bounced

**Example:** "Is now a good entry point for NVDA based on technicals?"

---

### 4. Sentiment (Market Opinion)

**Ask Bloom:** "What's the market sentiment on [STOCK]?"

**What to check:**
- Analyst ratings (Buy/Hold/Sell)
- Insider trading (buying or selling?)
- News sentiment (positive or negative?)

**Red flag:** Executives selling large amounts of stock

**Example:** "What are analysts saying about Tesla?"

---

### 5. Valuation (Price vs Worth)

**Ask Bloom:** "Is [STOCK] overvalued or undervalued?"

**What to check:**
- **P/E vs Industry:** Compare to similar companies
- **PEG Ratio:** P/E divided by growth rate (< 1 = undervalued)
- **Price Target:** Analyst consensus target price

**Example:** "Compare Amazon's valuation to Walmart's"

---

## Complete Evaluation Example

**Stock:** Microsoft (MSFT)

**Prompt:** "Should I buy Microsoft? Analyze fundamentals, earnings, technicals, sentiment, and valuation"

**AI Analysis:**
1. ✅ **Fundamentals:** P/E 32, revenue +12% YoY, strong margins (38%)
2. ✅ **Earnings:** Beat last 4 quarters, AI products driving growth
3. ⚠️ **Technicals:** RSI 68 (slightly overbought), wait for dip to $400
4. ✅ **Sentiment:** 85% analysts rate Buy, bullish on Azure
5. ⚠️ **Valuation:** Fairly valued (not cheap, not expensive)

**Decision:** BUY on dip to $400
