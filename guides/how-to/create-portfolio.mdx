## Portfolio Basics

A portfolio is your collection of investments. Good portfolios are **diversified** (spread across multiple stocks/sectors) to reduce risk.

**Key principle:** Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

---

## Step 1: Choose Your Allocation Strategy

### Conservative (Low Risk)
- 50% index ETFs (SPY, VOO)
- 30% dividend stocks (JNJ, PG, KO)
- 20% bonds or cash

**Best for:** New investors, retirement accounts, risk-averse

---

### Balanced (Medium Risk)
- 40% index ETFs
- 40% individual stocks (5-8 stocks)
- 20% growth stocks or sector ETFs

**Best for:** Most investors, 5-10 year goals

---

### Aggressive (High Risk)
- 60% individual stocks (8-12 stocks)
- 30% growth stocks (tech, AI)
- 10% speculative (small caps, emerging markets)

**Best for:** Young investors, long time horizon (10+ years)

**Ask Bloom:** "Which allocation strategy fits my risk tolerance?" (describe your situation)

---

## Step 2: Build Your Portfolio in Bloom

<Steps>
<Step title="Define your allocation">
Example: "I want a balanced portfolio with $10,000"
</Step>

<Step title="Ask AI for stock picks">
"Build me a balanced portfolio with 40% ETFs, 40% blue chips, 20% growth stocks"
</Step>

<Step title="Get AI recommendations">
Bloom suggests:
- 40% SPY (S&P 500 ETF)
- 15% AAPL (big tech)
- 10% MSFT (big tech)
- 10% GOOGL (big tech)
- 5% JNJ (healthcare)
- 10% NVDA (growth)
- 10% AMZN (growth)
</Step>

<Step title="Verify diversification">
"Analyze this portfolio for concentration risk"

AI checks:
- Sector exposure (not 100% tech!)
- Correlation (stocks don't all move together)
- Risk score (volatility)
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## Diversification Rules

### Rule 1: Spread Across Sectors
**Don't:** 100% tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA, AMZN)

**Do:** Mix sectors
- 30% tech
- 20% healthcare
- 20% financials
- 15% consumer goods
- 15% energy/utilities

**Ask Bloom:** "What's my sector exposure?" (after building portfolio)

---

### Rule 2: Limit Single Stock Positions
**Max 20% in any one stock** (except index ETFs)

**Ask Bloom:** "Is 30% in Apple too concentrated?"

---

### Rule 3: Include ETFs for Stability
**At least 30-40% in index ETFs** (SPY, VOO, QQQ) for diversification baseline

---

## Example Portfolios

### Conservative Portfolio ($10,000)
- $5,000 SPY (S&P 500)
- $2,000 JNJ (healthcare dividend)
- $2,000 PG (consumer staples)
- $1,000 cash

**Risk level:** Low | **Expected return:** 8-10%/year

---

### Balanced Portfolio ($10,000)
- $4,000 VOO (S&P 500)
- $1,500 AAPL
- $1,500 MSFT
- $1,000 JNJ
- $1,000 NVDA
- $1,000 V (Visa)

**Risk level:** Medium | **Expected return:** 10-12%/year

---

### Aggressive Portfolio ($10,000)
- $3,000 QQQ (Nasdaq ETF)
- $1,500 NVDA
- $1,500 TSLA
- $1,000 AAPL
- $1,000 GOOGL
- $1,000 AMZN
- $1,000 META

**Risk level:** High | **Expected return:** 12-15%/year (volatile)

**Ask Bloom:** "Analyze [one of these portfolios] for my situation"

---

## Rebalancing Your Portfolio

**When to rebalance:** Quarterly or when any position grows > 25%

**How to rebalance:**

<Steps>
<Step title="Check current allocation">
"What's my current portfolio allocation?"
</Step>

<Step title="Ask for rebalancing advice">
"How should I rebalance back to my target 40/40/20 allocation?"
</Step>

<Step title="Sell winners, buy losers">
If AAPL grew from 15% â†’ 30%, sell half and buy underweight positions
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
**Don't:**
- Invest all at once (dollar-cost average over 3-6 months)
- Copy someone else's portfolio without understanding it
- Ignore correlation (don't buy 5 similar tech stocks)
- Panic sell when markets drop 10%
- Forget to rebalance for 5 years
</Warning>

---

## Portfolio Health Check

**Ask Bloom these questions quarterly:**

1. "Analyze my portfolio for concentration risk"
2. "What's my portfolio's correlation score?"
3. "How much should I rebalance?"
4. "What's my portfolio's expected volatility?"
5. "Suggest 2 defensive stocks to add"
